# Summary

This paper presents OpTaS and OpTaS-ROS:
OpTaS is a task specification Python library for Trajectory Optimization (TO), Task and Motion Planning (TAMP), and Model Predictive Control (MPC) in robotics;
and OpTaS-ROS is an interface layer to the Robot Operating System [@Quigley09], allowing a user to programatically (un)load controllers/planners via a dedicated service.
Both TO and MPC are increasingly receiving interest in optimal control and in particular handling dynamic environments.

While a flurry of software libraries exists to handle such problems, they either provide interfaces that are limited to a specific problem formulation (e.g. TracIK, CHOMP), or are large and statically specify the problem  in configuration files (e.g. EXOTica, eTaSL).
OpTaS, on the other hand, allows a user to specify custom nonlinear and even discrete constrained problem formulations in a single Python script allowing the controller parameters to be modified during execution.
The library provides interface to several open source and commercial solvers (e.g. IPOPT, SNOPT, KNITRO, SciPy, OSQP, among others) to facilitate integration with established workflows in robotics.
Further benefits of OpTaS are highlighted through a thorough comparison with common libraries.
An additional key advantage of OpTaS is the ability to define optimal control tasks in the joint space, task space, or indeed simultaneously.
